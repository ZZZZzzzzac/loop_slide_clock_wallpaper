# loop slide clock
a slide clock based on js/html for wallpaper engine  

a loop version of [Slide Clock](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1286183699 "slide clock") by [GrimStorm](https://steamcommunity.com/id/j4cqu35), which is awesome.   
But I prefer a looped one, found nothing on workshop so I modified that and made this.

New to javascript so plz bear with my bad coding :)
